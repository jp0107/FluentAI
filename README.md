# FluentAI

## Background

This project seeks to explore the use of AI large language models to facilitate formative language assessment for learning, either within the context of a course of study or as self-regulated learning.

Providing students with frequent and varied opportunities to practice their language skills and to receive valuable, informative feedback is an essential part of second-language acquisition and often a difficult to integrate into traditional course curriculum. Given well-crafted prompts that include criteria for grading student writing, AI language models, such as ChatGPT, can provide students and instructors with useful information about the student's written language skills and guidance on how they might improve.

## Project Overview

FluentAI aims to solve the common problem in language learning of giving students opportunities to converse in a foreign language, while also providing them with timely feedback. By leveraging the ChatGPT API, we allow professors to input pre-written prompts with grading criteria. Students can then converse with the chatbot through short passages of written text, receiving corrections and assessments on their grammar, fluency, and lexical diversity. Furthermore, our stretch goals include turning our project into a mobile web application with a speech-to-text function for further accessibility, implementing statistical analysis features so that professors can examine student progress, and expanding our project into multiple languages.
